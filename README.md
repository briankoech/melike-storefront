# ProjectMelike

This is a store front app built with Angular and using dummyjson api. Nothing much goes on the API side.

### state management

- I've used ngrx for state management
- A mix of signals and observables for component state

### Architecture

- Feature based code organization.

### Missing features

- Authentication is missing
- Persisting cart missing
- Unit tests and e2e tests are also missing

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
